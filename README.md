## 08 - Updated Portfolio Page

## Description

For this homework assignment, I completely revised my portfolio page. I utilized customized Bootstrap elements, including a jumbotron, navbar, and cards to display content. I designed my portfolio page using the Bootstrap grid layout. I utilized jQuery to selectively modify content on the page. The design is responsive to different screen sizes as well. I chose three projects to display on the website: Stock News, Weather App! and Workday Scheduler. Stock News was a group collaboration. Weather App! and Workday Scheduler are both homework assignments that I felt reflected my current abilities as a web developer.
